            <h2>Policy for NDNC</h2>
            <p>
                At IBwise Tutor, we are committed to respecting and protecting the privacy of our users,
                particularly in compliance with the National Do Not Call (NDNC) Registry regulations. This
                policy outlines the measures we take to ensure that users who have opted out of
                telemarketing communications are not contacted. The NDNC Registry, maintained by the
                relevant regulatory authority in Kenya, allows consumers to register their phone numbers to
                avoid unsolicited marketing calls and messages. To comply, IBwise Tutor cross-checks our
                contact lists against the NDNC Registry before initiating any telemarketing campaign,
                ensuring no registered numbers are included.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also obtain explicit consent from users
                before contacting them for telemarketing purposes, providing clear opt-in options and
                informing them of their right to register with the NDNC. Users can easily opt-out of
                communications by contacting our customer service or using the provided opt-out options,
                and we promptly update our records to reflect these preferences. We maintain records of
                opt-outs and user consent, ensuring transparency and accountability. Our employees,
                contractors, and third-party service providers receive training on NDNC compliance and this
                policy, with regular refresher sessions to ensure ongoing adherence. Monitoring and periodic
                audits of our telemarketing activities are conducted to ensure compliance. Non-compliance
                with this policy results in disciplinary action, including termination of employment or
                contracts, with potential legal action for third-party providers. Users have the right to register
                their numbers with the NDNC, opt-out of receiving communications from us, and file complaints if their
                NDNC
                preferences are not respected. Complaints are investigated and
                addressed promptly by our customer service department. We reserve the right to update this
                policy as needed to comply with regulatory changes or improve our privacy practices,
                notifying users of significant changes. For any questions or concerns regarding this NDNC
                Policy, users can contact IBwise Tutor Customer Service via email at
                <a href="mailto:support@ibwisetutor.com">support@ibwisetutor.com</a> or by phone. By adhering to this
                policy, IBwise Tutor ensures
                that we respect our users' preferences and comply with national telemarketing regulations.
